/**
 * Admin alerts — the things a person at MDG has to act on, pushed to every
 * admin's phone and listed in the admin app until they are dealt with.
 *
 * ONE ALERT PER PROBLEM, NOT PER EVENT. A refused portal password makes a dozen
 * failed runs a day; it is one alert, raised once, that clears itself the first
 * time the password works again. That rule is the difference between a phone
 * that is listened to and one that is muted by Thursday, and it is why every
 * alert carries a `clearsWhen` sentence: the list says what makes it go away.
 *
 * Shared because the server decides who hears about a kind (`superAdminOnly`)
 * and the admin app labels the same kinds, and two copies of that table is how
 * a super-admin-only alert ends up on an account manager's screen.
